DEFENCE OF ROSCJUS.

sc. 80.

Saxeus Roscws was a rich and respected citizen ol Ameria, a
town (municipium) of Umbria, about fisty miles north ol Rome.
He had a taste for city lile, and spent most oi his time at Rome,
where he was on intimate terms with some oi the highest families,
especially the Metelli and Scipios. Meantime his son Sextus, who
certainly lacked his lather's cultivated tastes, and was accused by
his enemies oi rudeness and clownishness, had the care oi the
extensive family estates at Ameria.

sometime during the dictatorship oi Sulla-probably in the

’ autumn of 81 sc, - the elder Roscius was murdered one eveuing

as he was returning from a dinner party. The murder was no
doubt procured, or at least connived at, by one Titus Roscius
Magnus, his fellow-townsman and enemy. However that may be,

. the name oi the murdered man was put upon the proscription·list

by Chrysogonus, a freedman and lavorite of Sulla, who bought his
confiscated estates at auction ata nominal price. Three of these
estates (there were thirteen in all) he transferred toa certain Titus
Roscius Capito, another townsman and enemy of the deceased, and
a leading man at Ameria ; the remainder he put in charge ol

selves by accusing him oi his father's murder. This they did through
aprofessional prosecutor (accusator) named EruciuS, who undertook
the legal formalities of the prosecution.
