sense, ize. examination by tortore, the regular legal wayof exam·
ining slaves. ln a lew special classes of cases, the slaves of the
accused could be tortured in order to get evidence against their
master (see Milo, ch. 22). The master might, however, of his own
accord, offer them for tortore (pollzeeri): in this case Roscius had
lost his slaves, and so was deprived of this privilege-unua puer,
modified by non: the position makes the negative very emphatic.-
minister, i. e. to walt upon him.

14, {omnim this word, in its primary meaning, properly em·
braced the entire body of free persons, clients and slaves, under the
patriarchal rule of the paterfamilias. In time, the meaning was
divided, applying either (1) to a group of kinslolk having a common
name, -as Metellus, Scipio, Cicero, Caesar; (2) toa body (or gang)
of slaves. The latter is the meaning here. -floiplo, Metelle, these
were, probably, Ρ. Scipio Nasica, father of Metellus Scipio ( a leader
on Pompey's side in the civil war), and his cousin, Q. Metellus
Nepos, brother of Caecilia (5 50), and father of the Celer and Nepos
referred to in the orations against Catiline.-·advooetle, sum·
moned (as friends ol the accused); egentibus, taking active port.
The demand seems to have been formal, and these friends were
present to attest it- nllqnotlem, several times. —mernlnlstlene,
don't you rontemnere-n. Rosolnm, i. e. Magnus—seotautur,
weit on.

5 36. aureum: the Greek name Chrysogonus means gold-bern.
-latuitz because his was the only name that appeared—alil
, quoque, i. e other purchasers of confiscated estates. --eeotornmt
these were the purchasers of confiscated property in the lump, who
afterwards elioided it (seeo) to sell again in detail. The word also

· means both cut-throat and cut-perse, and was perhaps used here to

imply, hythe double meaning, that these men connived at the death
of the proscribed.

ξ 37. venierunt, were sold (ξ 35, 2, b).—tantue homo, suche
great person : ahint that more important men than he had suffered.
ln fact, all the really eminent victims of the civil war had perished
before the proscription-Valerla: the law by which Sulla was
made perpetual dictator and invested with absolute power of· life
and death (Β. c. 82): it was proposed by 1„ Valerius Flaccus as
interrex. Laws were designated by the gentile name of their pro·
poser: all laws, for example, carried by L. Cornelius Sulla were
known as Leges Cornelio-cornelli: this may refer to some mere
edict of Sulla (as suggested by Halm), which depended sor its va·
lidity as a law upon the Lex Valeria, and hence Cicero's affected

¹ ignorance.-novl, Ι know the thing or pers0n3 noto, l know the

fact: I om not acquainted with the low, and do not know which
it is.
