os the systematis plan os a deliberative oration than anyother ot* antiquity. It was
delivered in a coeth, ‚or public meeting oi Roman citizens, held for debete or address
merely. The contio noirld be called by any magistrate who had any matter to lay before
the people, and was held regularly in the Comitium, or elevated part ol the Forum (See

rogatis had been thus discussed‚ the romain (see note on Verr- 1. ἦ 18) voted upon it,
Yes or No.
