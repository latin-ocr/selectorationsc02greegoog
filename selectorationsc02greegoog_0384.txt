sponsibility resting on the Senate: the Consul will not fail them-Peroratio. ro. He
cares nothing for himself: his fame is sure. Tm war he has taken up is without end;
but the harmony of the State shall be unbroken·- 11. Let them remember bis political
sacrifices; but vote only for the weltare and safety of the State.

As this is the first deliberative oration, delivered in the Senate, contained in this col·

lection, it will be well to describe the course of a senatorial debate.

Tm Senate could be called together by any magistrate possessing the civil impertiam
§regularly the consul), also by the Tribunes of the People: the magistrate who summoned
it also presided, and laid before it (referre) the business for which it was summoned.
He might at this· point give his own judgment. Then he proceeded to ask (rogare) the
Senators individually their opinions (sententia). The order was to ask in turn the con·
salares, preaterii, adr‘lt'cii, and questoria· ,¹ that is, those who sat in the Senate in virtue
of having held these offices respectively. If the annual election had already taken place,

which was usually in J uly, -six months before the new magistrates assumed their offices, - ·

- the magistrates elect, designati, were called upon before their several classes The prin·
ceps Senatus (see note, Cat. ΙΙΙ. § ro) was called upon first of all, when there were no
cannales desigmti. The presidiug officer had it indeed in his power to vary the order, and
honor or slight any senator by calling upon him extra ordinem.

The business was as a rule laid before the Senate in general terme, not in any special
form for action: each senator could, as he chose, give his iudgment in full, by argument

(sententiam dicere), or simply express his assent to the judgment of another (verbo
assentiri). Only those who held seats by virtue oi having held magistracies were entitled

todo this; the others, who were enrolled by the Censors to fill up the number, were called
pedarii, and had no right to speak‚ but only to vote (reddas ire in sententiam). The
x vote was taken by going on one side or other of the house (dz'scessr'ol When a majority
had decided in favor of any sententia, it was written out iu proper form by the secretaries
(scribae), under the direction of the president, in the presence of some of its principal
supporters (adesse scribundo), and promulgated.

In the present case, what should be done with the captured conspirante-the consul
elect, D. Junius Silenus, had advised that they be put to death: and C. Julius Casar, as
praetor elect, that they be kept in custody. At the end of the discussion, the presiding
consul gave his views in this speech.
