at that time possessed Latin citizenship ; that is, the Latin colonies,
such as Venusia, the birth-place of the poet Horace.

Colonies sent out by Rome were of two classes: 1. Romen colones, in which a small
garrison of soldiere (usually 300 in numberiwas established as a governing aristocracy.
The native population was held by them in a harsh subjection. 2. Latin cotonies. in
which the colonists‚ whether native Romans or not, formeria quasi-independent conr-
munity. They were usually quite numerous, went with their families, and did not possess
Roman citizenship; but. on the other hand, the right of coining money and other rights
of sovereignty. These Latin colonies, together with the original Letins, formed the nomen
Latinum, and stood towards Rome in the relation os civitates soederntoe. Therefore

Roman citizens who went into exile could sojoum in these towns as is they formed no part
of Italy. This was called jus exsilii.
