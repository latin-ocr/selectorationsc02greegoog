xii Lffia ιγ Cicero.

his efforts as reconciler, Cicero joined that party in the fatal
’ campaign of Pharsalia (Β. c. 48).

When Pompey was dead, and the senatorial party finally
crushed, Cicero submitted, with apparent good will, to
tlte dictatorship of Caesar, whose personal friend he had
always claimed to be. But his letters show'him at this time
disappointed, peevish‚ jealous, and weak. It was, however,
the period of his greatest industry and fertility as a wrlter.
A long succession of dialogues and treatises attests his
efforts to distract his mind from the miseries of his political
failure and defeat. After the death of Caesar, which he
perhaps witnessed with his own eyes, -at any rate rejoiced
at,*-he appeared once more in public life, the standard·
bearer in the brave battle waged by the Senate against
Mark Antony. During tlris struggle he was a warm parti-
san of Brutus and Cassius, “ the liberators.’' He proclaimed
openly his satisfaction at Caesar's death; hoped to win the·
confideuce of the young Caesar Octavianus (afterwards Au·
' gustus) ς and took part against Antony, as a public enemy,
in the celebrated orations called Philippics. When the
cause was lost by the treachery of Octavianus, when he and
Lepidus joined Antony, amd their triumvirate was victorious,
Cicerowas one of the first victims marked for proscription.
He was murdered near his Formian villa, on the road be·
tween Rome and Naples, in December, Β. c. 43, at the age
of sixty·three.
