uc. 52.

Duurwo the absence of Caesar in Gauhand after the disastrous
campaign of Crassus in the East (Β. c. 54), Pompey remained in
Rome, with an influenee which would have amounted to absolute
power, if he had been a man of more political sagacity, and had
known his own mind better. The real leader of the popular party
atthis time was Clodius,a man of versatile and brilliant gifts, of
high birth but infamous life, a bitter and unscrupulous partisan iu
politics; while, after the death of Crassus, the unnatural coalition
was dissolved‚ and Pompey drifted easily into the ranks of the oli·
garchy, where his real sympathies attached him. The strife of par-

elected-who should have been chosen six months before the be·
ginning of the year. The next year began with the same disorder,
aud with no consuls. Milo was a candidate for the consulship, but
his election had been successfully resisted by Clodius. On the ruth,
of January, the quarrel came to a bloody crisis. Milo had set out.

twenty miles ΞΕ. of Rome, where he held an office of some local

of his estates. As they passed each other, their mob of followers
came to blows. Clodius was wouuded, and driven into a shop or
