CICERO'S EXILE AND RETURN.

(Extract from tlte Desence os Sestius.)

nc. 56

Tire year u. c. 60 is marked by tbe coalition. between Caesar,
Pompey, and Crassus, -sometimes called the F irst Triumvirate, -
of which the immediate result was the election of Caesar to the
consulship for the following year. During the existence of this
corthon, the Senate was almost wholly stripped of power. The
chief act of Caesar's administration was his iniquitous law for
dividing the fertile' and populous territory of Campania among
needy citizens of Rome; which was vcarried with such a degree of

consuls, Gabinius and Piso, refused to interfere. Pompey would

. not meet or see his eloquent advocate. Caesar, just departing for

⁸ his campaigns in Gaul, waited till he should be assured of Clodius's
triumph. As the affair was just coming to blows, Cicero withdrew
into voluntary exile, which was followed, the next day, by a decree
(privilegium) forbidding him by name the use of fire or water
-the regular formula for a sentence of banishment-anywhere
within four hundred miles of Rome.

The year of his exile Cicero spent mostly in Thessalonica, with
his friend Plancius, quaestor of Macedonia, the same whom be
afterwards defended on a charge of bribery. In the summer of the
following year be was restored, “ by the late but earnest efforts
