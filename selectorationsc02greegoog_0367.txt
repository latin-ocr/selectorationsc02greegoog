word is used (as well as censeo, placet) to express the intent
of the Senate; the consultum, ordinante, or any separate article
of it, might, as regarded its purport, be called decretum.

Lucius Opimiuswas consul n. c· rer, when Caius Gracchus, the younger brother οἱ
Tiberius, was attempting to carry through a series os measures far more revolutionary than
those of his brother. The Senam, the champion ol the existing order os things, took
alarin, and intrusted the consul with absolute power. ln the tumult that ensued, some
3‚ooo were said to have lost their lives, including Gracchus and his leading associate
Fulvius.

The father os the Gracchi was Tiberius Gracchus, oue of the most eminent statesmen
ot* his day, distinguished sor integrity and humanity, as well as ability and culture⁴ Their
mother was Cornelia, daughter ot' Scipio Africanus, the conqueror os Hannibal. Aneestors
on both sides were distinguished in the Second Punic War, and the brothers were likewise ,
connected by kinsbip and marriage with many ol the noblest families of Rome.

in league with the revolutionists, — Saturninus and Servilius Glaucia, corrupt demagoguer,
unworthy imitatore oi the noble Gracchi. When it came to the point, however, the
courage of Marius failed him: he deserted his accomplicec, aud joined the Senate in
crushing the revolt.

reipublicae, poss. gen, the punishment being looked onas some-

the senators—buJ'uaoe modi, i. e. like those others-tabulis,
brazen tablets‚ on which the lans, dte, were inscribed. The edict
is said to be shut up in them (until put in force), like a swerd
hid in its scabbard-tnteriectum eece (ἓ 58, 1⁸1‚d). But, after
all, it would have been hardly possible, even with the extraordinary
power granted to the consuls, to put the conspirator to death with-
out some overt act. —eupio, Ι am anxz‘ous (emphatic) : aconces-
sion, opposed by aed, below. - dissolutum, hasty, as having one’s
actions out of the control of law, reason, &c —ipaez Latin in such
cases emphasizes the subject, English the object—nequitiae,
wortklessness.

ξ 5. faucibus, narrow pass, leading north from Etruria—
oonlooata‚ § ⁷2, 2, d. -jam, at once. — erit verendum, etc. This
difficolt sentence is best rendered by connecting non and potius
with verendum: Isltall not have more reason to sear,- and by
remembering that credo is, in this parenthetical use, ironical. The
sense is, of course Ι shall bc acctcsed of cruelty rather than slack·
nasa—boni (sc. dicant): here, as usual, tlte well-z‘ntenttonerl,
