The ieamer is greatly accen (as, indeed. the Romans themselves musthave been) in
the understanding of a sentence like this, by noticing the way in which one word is set clf
against another Thus, besides the case just mentioned, &tum obscurum esse is opposed
to temere dicto concedi ,· so propter nobilitatem is opposed tc propter amem, and occul·
tum etc, to ignosci, etc. At the same time, mooun is parallel with obscurum, aud ignosci
with concedi. These antitheses are indicated in various ways, - (a) by emphatic and sirn-
ilar or chiastio pontion, as here ceterorum precedes neqree and ego precedes π’ᾳκὰὶ, though
the connective is usually placed first; (b) by particles, as the correlative nequo. . . euque,
aud vel . . . vel.

dietum is anoun limited by ceterorum (in tlte case of tho others); ’

dicto is also a noun, though moditied by an adverb (see examples
under ξ 72, a, a). -'- concedi (impersonal, 551, 2, s), allowed or put

subject supplied from si quid (ς 51. 2, c).-tgnoscendi ratio, tlte
rma ospordon. As Latin has iewabstract nouns, their place is sup-
plied in varicus other ways. The thought is, not only pardoning,
butenen official investigation (cognoscendi) itas ceored in tlte stote
(in consequence oi the stormy times oi Sulla). But this thought
can hardly be expressed in any other way than by the general word
ratio with a genitive, which we may translate as above.

“This is boldlysaid.at a time when the tyrant Sullawas in power. Sulla neverpar·
doned, and inquiry iu legal form was cut oi sashion; at least such a trial asan innocent man
