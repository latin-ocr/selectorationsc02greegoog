x Iffe of Cicero.

devoting himself to his private studies· He appears to have

a· welcomed the triumph of Sulla (Β. c. 82) as an earnest of

order and good government; but was soon disgusted with
the despotic rule of the dictator, and placed himself in that
attitude of moderate opposition to the oligarchy to which
he was, on the whole, faithful through life. No person
dared oppose Sulla in anypolitical measure; but in the
administration of justice even the tyrant was obliged, for

decency's sake, to listen to words of truth and boldness. ’

The defence of Roscius, Cicero's first public oration (a. c.

exile, without waiting the result of the trial. The legislation
of this year identified Pompey with the popular party3 and
Α 'Cicero attached himself to the interests of that ambitious
and successful general, giving him timely aid-in the
speech for the Manilian Law —in obtaining the command

Cicero held the praetorship, having been curule aedile three
