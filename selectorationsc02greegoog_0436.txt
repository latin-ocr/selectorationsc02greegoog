227, § 18. mortuus, “in lisgrave.” -contumauam Caesar’s
proconsular command in Gaul ended March 1, B. c. 49. It was
usual in such cases to continue in command until the next first
ol January, on the principle that every tenure of office continued
until a successor was appointed rand, in consequence ol a law
of Sulla, the consuls and praetors went to the government of
provinces immediately on the expiration of their term of office in
the city. A new law of Pompey's, however, had provided that
five years should intervene between the magistracy and the gov-
ernorship, so that it would be easy to appoint a successor to Caesar
at the legal expiration ol his office. vFurther, Caesar had been
exempted by law from the necessity of presenting himself in per·
son as a candidate sor the consulship of Β, c. 48. His plan was to
be elected in his absence, to retain his proconsulship until the day
when he should assume the consulship again, and thus to have no
gap between the two offices. If there were a gap of a single day,
his enemies were on the watch to prosecute him, for various acts
which were at any rate irregular. Their policy was to abrogate
his command, if possible, and at any rate to repeal the law which
allowed him to be a candidate while absent. The year 50 Β. c.
was consumed in fruitless negotiations and attempts at compro-
mise; when Pompey and the Senate at last cut off further de·
bate, refused all concessions to Caesar, and declared war. It
was this treatment which Cicero describes as contumelio-pa·
cem esse cupiebas: it seems certain that Caesar had, in his
desire sor peace, carried his offers of compromise as far as was
possible-ut tibi conveniret, thal you should come to an un-
derstandz'og (in appos. with td).
