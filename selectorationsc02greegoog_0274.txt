2, § 1. credo . . . periculum vitant. This paragraph maybe
analyzed as an example of the involved periodic style of Latin
writers. The main clause is oredo 0303 the rest of the sentence
is all the objectos oredo in the indirect discourse (ξ 67, 1).* The
main verb of the discourse is mlrarl (changed from miramini).
