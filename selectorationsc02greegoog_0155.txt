rac. 62.

Tura case oi Archias, though not a public one, yet had its origin

iu the politics of the tirne. The-aristocratic faction, suspecting

that much of the strength oi their opponents was derived from the
fraudulent votes oi those who were not citizens, procured in rac. 65
the passage of the Lex Papia, by which “all the strangers‚ who pos· l
sessed neither Roman nor Latin burgess-rights, were ejected from Ῠ
the capital ” (Mommsen). Archias, a native of Antioch, but for ᾖ
many years a Roman citizen, a friend oi Lucius Lucullus, was “
accused in rae. 62, by a certain Gratius, under this law, on the ]
ground that he was not a citizen. The case was tried before l
the praetor Quintus Cicero, brother oi the orator. ,
lt was a very small matter to disprove the charge, and com· ,
pletely establish Archias's claims to citizenship. The greater part J
of the speech, theremre, is made up oi an eulogy upon the poet, ;
and upoir poetry and literature in general. lt is, for this reason, l
one of the most agreeable of Cicero's orations, and perhaps the j

greatest favorite oi themall. ·
