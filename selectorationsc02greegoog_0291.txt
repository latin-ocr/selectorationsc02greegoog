a protasis contrary to fact), what was chiefly to bc wished. -quod

impensuri—invidiam infamiamque, odium and dishonor,
from the partisan use of the courts hythe Senators (see Rosc.
Am. ἓ 3). These points are here emphasized‚ as being os quite
equal importance with the conviction or acquittal of Verres. ln
fact, the trial turns more on the character of the court than on
the guilt of the accused, which was notorious-vestri ordinis,
i. e, the senatorial, from which the judices were atthis time taken.
(See note on judices, R. A. § 1.) The word Ordo was used loosely
to describe any recognized body of citizens-as freedmen‚ publicans,
clerks ; it was more especially used of the two powerful classes of
the Roman Aristocracy‚ the Senatorial and the Equestrian, which
struggled with each other for power during the last century of the
Republic.
