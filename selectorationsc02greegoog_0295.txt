28, § tr. adulescentia, i. e. before he entered public life.-
quaes'tura, questorslzip, the first grade of political honor.

The quaestors were at this time twenty in number, two having charge of the treasury
and archives in the city, while the others were assigned to the several military commanders
and provincial govemors, to serve as quartermasters and paymasters. Aspirants for honors
were required to serve as quaestors before presenting themselves for the praetorship, which
was, again, a requirement for the consulship. The office of curule aedile was regularly
held-as by Cicero -between the quaestorship and praetorship. That this was not neces·
sary, however, as is often assumed, is proved hythe fact that there were six praetors, but
only two curule aediles. (See Mommsen R‘dm. Staatsrecht, vol. i. p 443.)

Carbonem: Carbo was the leader of the Marian faction after
the death of Marius and Cinna He was consulantis, the year
of Sulla‘s return and victory. Verres was his quaestor, and went
over to the enemy with the money-chest, when he saw which side
was likely to premit-necessitudinem religionemque: the
quaestor was originally nominated specially by the consul; and the
peculiarly close 'and sacred relation (necessitudo) existing between
them was known as pietas-a sentiment of filial affection. (See
Lange, Rom. Alt. vol. i. p. 633.) The designation by lot (sors)
· was also held to bea token of divine will, and so sacred (relagata).
—legatim the legatus, or aad, was a member of the general’s stall,
and stood in something of the same relation to him as the quaestor.
Verres, as legatus, served Dolabella much as he had served Carbo:
not that either of those infamous commanders deserved better
treatment—Asiae: the province of this name, the old kingdom of
Pergamus embraced the western part of Asia Minor. The prov-
ince of Dolabella (Β. c. 80-79) was Cilicia. His extortions and
those of Verres were in, the adjoining regions os Pamphylia, Pisidia,
and parts of Asia. The word totius is therefore arhetorical ex·
aggeration.

The term provincia was primarily used to designate the special field of operations as·
signed (by lot, agreement, or designation of the Senate) to a consul or other military com·

mandet. When a foreign territory was conquered and reduced to a subjection to Rome,
the govemment of it was assigned to one of the praetors‚ or the imperium of a consul or

praetorwasextended (prorogatum) forasecond year for this purpose. The foreign state ·

thus organized as a Roman dependency was called by the old name provincia ,· and this
special use of the word is more familiar in classicwriters than its original meaning. Of the
states here mentioned, Asia was an organized province, while Cilicia, Pisidia, and Pam·
phylia were provinces only in the early sense of the word: Cilicia, however, was the regular
provincia or special command, of a propraetor, whose field of operations waswesterrr
Cil'cia (Cilicia Aspera), with the adioiniug coast-line of Pamphylia, arid mountain region of
Pisidia. - cilina was not fonnally organized as a province until n. c. 75. As governor of
aprovince in the later sense of the word, the pro-prator exercised direct rule only over
those portione of the country which had been subjugated by Rome, while the geographical

- limita of his province enclosed also allied and independent communities, civitates δαείω

and liberte (see Kuhn, Verfassung des nanneten. vol. ii. p. 14); some of which paid
tribute, while others were tribute-free, immunes, as well as legally exempt from his au·
thority in matters of administration. Praetically‚ however, even these last were under his
almost unlimited control. -
