236 Tne Striiggle against Antony. [PfflL. XIV.

Bononia, while Pansa's fate was unknown, that Cicero, in the
Senate, delivered his fourteenth and last Philippic.

The rejoicings were soon at an end. Octavianus found that his
own interests were best served by uniting with Antony against the
Senate. These two-with Lepidus asathird triumuir-came
easily into possession of supreme power. A remorseless proscrip-
tion followed, in which the most illustrious victim was Cicero, sac-
rificed to Antony’s resentment, the vindictive hate'of Fulvia, and
the cold ingratitude of Octavianus.

Of the fourteen Philippics, the Second is by fag the most famous.
It isa long and elaborate invective,— in some parts exceedingly
bitter and coarse‚ - reviewing the domestic and political career of
Mark Antony, charging him with every personal vice and almost
every public crime. In its allusions to the public acts os Cae-
sar, its hostility is uncompromising, vindictive, often scornlul.
The revival of the title “perpetual dictator '' seems to have inspired
‘Cicero with hatred, horror, and fear3 and his real hostility was no
longer disguised after Caesar's death. This oration contains the
celebrated portrait of him, interesting as the only extant testimony,
publicly spoken at the time, of one who was at once contemporary,
peer, and rival τ -

Fuit in i'lla ingenium, ralia, memoria, litteratura, cegitatio,
diligentia. Res bella gesserat, quamvis reipublice calamitosas, at
· tamen magnas. Multas annas regnare meditatim, magna labare,
multis perieulis, quad cogitarat effemat. Muneribus, inanimen-
tis, congiariis, epulis multitudinem imperitam delenierat: snas
premiis, adversarias clementia specie'devinrerat. Quid inulta?
attulerat jam libera civitati, partim metu partim patientia, consue-
tudinem serviendi. Sed ex plurimis malis, qna ab illa rei publiea
snnt inusta, liae tamen bani est, quad didicit jani papulus Romanus
qnantum cuique crederet, quibus se committeret, a quibus caveret.

The Fourteenth Philippic has a unique interest as the last free
voice of the Roman Senate, and from its ill-timed confidence in the
future emperor. Itis also interesting as an example of labored and
stately panegyric on patriots fallen in- battle, after the manner of the
Greeks, and from the formal resolution of thanks and honor with
which it closes. Its immediate occasion was a resolution of B.
’ ServiliuS, that the citizens should lay aside the military garb, and
that a public thanksgiving should be celebrated in honor of the
victory. ·
