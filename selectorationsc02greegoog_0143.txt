In the Senam, Dec. 5.

. Two days later the Senate was convened, to determine what was

to be'done with the prisoners. lt was a fundamental principle of
the Roman Constitution that no citizen should be put to death
without the right of appeal to the people. Against the view of
Caesar, which favored perpetual confinement, Cicero urged the
very lame argument that, by the fact of taking up arms against the
Republic, they had forfeited their citizenship, and the law therefore
did not protect them. This view prevatled and the conspirators ¹
—Lent ulus, Cethegus, StatiliuS, Gabinius, and Caeparius- -were
strangled by the public executioners.

This was one of those acts of excessive vigor and severity which
aman who feels himself deficient tn decision of character-as
Cicero was, at bottom-will sometimes force himself to commit ⁴
Had he had the strength to maintain himself as a leader in public
affairs, it need not have hurt him iu the end. As it was, he was

⁴ soon pushed aside by men of genuine executive power, Pompey
and Caesar, and was made to suffer severely for his illegal act.
