R LIGARIUS.
Β. o. 46.

Tnouou the case of Ligarius is of no importance in itself, the
speech of Cicero in his defence ranks among the first of his ora-
tions in rhetorical merit; and is interesting, besides, for the glimpse
it gives of the state of feeling in Rome during Caesar's dictatorship.

Quintus Ligarius had held a subordinate position in Africa, in
the Pompeian army under Ρ. Attius VaruS, in the first year of
the Civil War. ln this capacity it had fallen to him to prevent
the landing of L. AElius Tubero, whom the Senate had sent to. take
command in Africa, but to whom Varus refused to give up the post.
When then the war was over, Caesar spared the life of Ligarius,
hut kept him in exile, until a personal application was made by his
brother for his recall. Quintus Tubero (afterwards a distinguished
jurist) came forward to oppose this, on the ground that Ligarius had
not merely taken sides in the Civil War, but had stood with'Juba and
the foreign enemies of Rome against his native country. The case
was argued in the Forum before Caesar himself, sitting in judgment .
as Dictator. Caesa'r, with characteristic magnanimity‚ gave Ligarius
a full pardon. This Ligarius requited, a year and a half later, by
joining in'the plot for Caesar's murder. ..
