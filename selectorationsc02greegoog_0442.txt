  , sometimes granted by the Senate, in cases when the proportions

or circumstances of the victory, or the rank of the commander, did
not warran't the supreme honoros a triumph (see note, Man. ς 8).
The general did not wear the purple embroidered robe, or the laurel
crown, but the ordinary toga protextu, and a wreath of myrtle.

ᾗ 14. Parilibus: the Partho or Palilia (April 21) was one of
the most ancient Roman festivals, in honor of Pales, a goddess
os llocks. This day was regarded as the anniversary of the found·

what formal authority—augur, J au augur (emphatic): i. e. an
augur would know his science too well for such an attempt This
was the latest of Cicero’s official honum, received ten years before ;
and he fully appreciates the dignity of the priestly craft.

While an augur had the power os interpreting the auspices, only magistrates had the
power ol taking them (see note, Cat lV. 2); and augura were not in any sense magis·
trates. Further, any assumption of power would be invalid unless confirmed by auspices.
Cicero, though an augur, was unable to take the first preliminary step to any usurpation ⁴
oi power. A technical obstacle like this would not stand long in the way ola medem
usurper; but the stress here laid upon it illustrares the degree in which the peculiar lor-
malism os the Roman religion had become worked into the Roman mind; and further,
the power exercised by this adhererice to torm in protecting the institutions of the State.

traderem: the imperium, as well as the auspiczu, descended
by regular successim, like ecclesiastical functions in the church.
