NOTE.

'rins Selection follows strictly the text of Banna and Karsan ae

, a new textus receptus, even when the editors would personally prefer

ζὴ, indifferent reading. They have, however, rejected the double r' in

'r ᾗ the genitive of the second declension‚ which must have been un·

known to Cicero.

⁴ , The orations l'or Roscius and l'or Sestius are considerabl y abridged‚

on account of ⁴their length and some special difficulties. They are

Ἴ inserted sor their exceptional importance in reference to the orator’s

career, and they are especially recommended to studente sor that

ι reason. Teachers will find great advantage in using such parts

as are not necessary in the regular school course, as exercises

ἶ ¹ in reading at sight-a practice which cannot be too highly

recommended, and for which the shorter selectione are more

Ἴ '· particularly intended.
