nc. 63.

Dnnrnn the absence of Pompey in the East (see the preceding
Introduction), the politics of the city were kept in a constant fer· ἶ
ment by the strife of parties. The violence and corruption of the ”
time seemed to afford a fit opportunity for some daring enterprise.
This opportunity was seized by Lucius Sergius Catilina. He wasa ‹
man of noble birth, of middle age, andos the vilest character; an j
intimate fn'end of Verres, and like him distinguished for his infa- s
mous career in Sulla's army. He expected, probably, to make him· i
self tyrant, as Dionysius and Agathocles - men no better than he- l
had done in Syracuse; but it was suspected at the time, and is
believed by many at the present day, that he was, after all, onlya ᾖ,
tool of Caesar and Crassus, the leaders of the democratic party. ,

Catiline’s plan was to make use of the consulship as a stepping- ¹3

’ stone to the tyranny; and with this end he desired to be a candi· ξ
date for this office, for the year uc. 65. He was shut out, however,
both that year and the next, by a charge of repetunda: of this he ¹
was at last acquitted, in season to present himself for the year
uc. 63. There was a very exciting canvass, which resulted in the ,
election of Cicero by an overwhelming majority, while a confede- ¹
rate of Catiline‚ Caius Antonius-son of the distinguished orator, ' 3
and uncle of the triumvir—was elected as his colleague. Catiline‚

ἵ , nothing daunted, offered himself again for the following year,but
was again defeated, mainly through the exertions of the consul Ci· y
cero, who had completely gained over his weak and greedy colleague ἦ
Antonius, The rich province of Macedonia had fallen to Cicero
by lot, for his proconsular year; but he transferred this to Anto·
nius, on condition of his cooperation against Catiline. Ἰ

Catiline would now wait no longer, but prepared for an immedi· ¹
ate outbreak. As a private citizen he lost the advantages which

theholding of the consulship would have given him, and the only ,
member of the conspiracy who held a magistracy was the vain and l
indolent Lentulus, praetor and of consular rank. In the course

’ of October, nc. 63, a body of troops was collected at Faesulae (now
Fiesola close to Florence)‚a town in the north of Etruria; this
was under the command of the centurion Caius Manlius, Catiline
