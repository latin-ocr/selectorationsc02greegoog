umphalem: the captives did not go with or behind the triumphal ’

chariot, but preceded it in the processioa—bis liberavit: hythe
victories over the German invaders,— over the Teutones at Aquae
Sextiae(n.c 102), and the Cimbri at Campi Raudii (uc. 101).-Pom-
psius: it should be remembered that Pompey was now in the East,
in the midst of his career of conquest, and that his return was
looked for with expectancy by all parties. Cicero took every means

to win the confidence os the grean general, and gain him over to his ’

views in public affairs; but to uo purpose. After some wavering,
he associated himself with Caesar, thus giving the Senate ablow
from which it never recovered, and preparing the way ior his own
downfall.

thus surrendering his province, he renounced all thought oi gaining
a triumph, the highest honor to which a Roman could aspire—
ollentelis hospitiisque: the relation of cliens to patronus was
that of a subordinate to a superior, carrying with it services on the
one side and protection on the other; the hospites were, on the
other hand, equals, and their connection was one ol mutual aid and
friendship. Foreign states and citizens were eager to form such
ties with influential Romans, and they were equally advantageous
to the Roman. Oi course a provincial governor had peculiar oppor-
tunities for this-urbanis opibus, the means afforded by a city
life. Such ties would be formed by a sojourn in the province; hut
their value to the provincial consisted in the opportunities lor pro-
tection and assistance which a Roman statesman possessed in the
city. -t-pro meis studiis, in reward of my efforts. -satls praesidi,
