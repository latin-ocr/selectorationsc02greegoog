Lanuviumwas an old town of latium, about twenty miles south-east ot Rotas. It
contained a temple of Juno Sospita, a local divinhy, so farnous diat, when Lanuvium
beram a municipium oi Rome, this sanctuary was, by special arrangement, received into
the Roman religious system. The floran, or special priest‚ of Juno Sospita must bs
inaugtuated by the chief magistrate (dictator) of the maneeipr'arm. Milo, of Lanuvian
origin‚a munr'ceps of the town, now held this office. (ltwitl be noticed that the title
dictator, which at Rome meant au extraordinary magistrate with kingly power, was
given in the Latin towns to their regular republican chief magistrate)

fourth hour (between ten and eleven A. tu ).— calceos: the senator
wore shoes adorned-with a crescent-shaped ornament (lunula):

occidunt, they attach arrd kile-animo fideli, faithful,· prae-
