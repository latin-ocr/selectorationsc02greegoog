Dolabella was bad enough, buthe had to bear the added infamy of
Verres' outrageous acts, and after all Verres saved himself by turn·

extortion.

§ 12. praetnra urbana: this is the topic of the first oration of

the accusatio.

There were at this time eight praetors, whose office it was to preside over the adminis-
tration of jusdem alter the expiration of their year of office, they went as pro-premes to

prator urbanus. who had the charge of civil esses between Roman citizens: the pret
peregrinas had civil cases in which aliens were a party: the other six presided evera
Quoestr'oner perpetua. The prator urbanus, having charge of all civil cases between
citizens, had almost unlimited power of plunder, and this was used by Verres without
scruple. His colleague, the prator peregrim, filled several books with mses in which he

rules. The functione of the praetor were summed up in these words no (judicem, aaa·

the aedile, not of the prator: the cases referred to here were, there-

Senate eame (in the 3d cent. a c.) to be the actual governing power in the State, these
consulta became ordinatam, in which the Senate directed the administration of the whole
empire. The organization of a new province, e. g.,was not bya law of the people‚ but by aa
ordinance of the Senatet and in this ordinancewas embodied the entire authority of Rome
over the province, except so far as this was prescribed by general laws. This suas leges

retain them: communia jura, the principles of justice recognized by all natione: senaa

organized and governed.

communia jura, the same as jus gentium, those laws common to

all mankind (see note on jur gentium, R. A. 547). The terms
