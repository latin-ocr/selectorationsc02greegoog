LIFE OF CICERO.

Marcus Tuccius Crcsno ranks as the first prose writer
in Roman literature, and in fame as the second orator of the
world. His public life, lasting nearly forty years, covers
the entire period from Sulla's dictatorship to the fall of the

and, after his death, with his yet more distinguished kins-
man of the same name3 and was intimate with the eminent

grandfather of the triuvar. He studied rhetoric and phi·
losophy with the best Greek teachers3 and from the poet
Archias in particular, whom he afterwards defended in oue

literature which distinguished him among all the public

with the overthrow of the Republic. He served a short
campaign iu the Social War (Β. c. 89); but remained in
obscurity through the horrors of the civil war that followed,
