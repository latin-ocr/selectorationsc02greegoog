eminent merits, partly by the wsve of moderate reform,
into the consulship (a. c. 63), at the age of form-three.

Cicero was now at the highest point of his success arrd
fame, the recognized head of a moderate party, which
aimed to preserve the old institutions of the State, while
tempering them with a more liberal policy. Bothe lacked
the qualities of a successful political leader. He was vain,
hesitating, lacking sels-control, decision, and dignity of
character. As a “new man,” he never lrad the full conli-
dence of the senatorial families3 while his tastes were too
much slraped by his Greek training, his mind too delicately
organized, his ambition too much controlled by sentiment
and theory, -we may say, by the sense of right,-to give
him a hold upon the crowd that filled the Forum and
carried the Comitia. The leading act of his administration
-the suppression of Catiline's Conspiracy-had, by the
illegal death of the conspirators, made him the object of
marked hostility to the popular party. The democratic
movement became too strong for his feeble grasp, and
developed into a destructive radicalism, headed by unscru·
pulous gamblers and demagoguesr which had its natural
sequence in civil war and imperialism.

Five years aster his consulship (s. c. 58, the same year
with Caesar's first campaignin Gaul), Cicero was forced
into exile. Though he was recalled the following year,
with every mark of honor, it was to find orderly government
almost at an end. The magnificent defence of Milo—a
speech which, as it now stands, was never delivered- was

more imminent in Rome. The two following years he

served as Proconsul in Cilicia, and returned, with the com· ·

plimentary title of z'rnperatom to find all things ripe for civil
war. Pompey, both because he hated Caesar, and because
there was no one else to take the place, drifted into the
position of leader and general of the conservative party.
