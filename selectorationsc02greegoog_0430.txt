A rgument.

enar. r. Caesai’s clemency in victory is glorious for himself and bonorable for
Marcellus-2. Warlike glories depend on many outward circumstances: this gloryis
wholly his own -3. Conquestis a natural and ,frequent thing: seli-conquest is a divine
attribute. Other praises are drowned hythe noise of war: this wius love and gratitude. -
4. This glory none can claim to share. Victory itself is conquered when its rights are
renounced.-5‚ 6, This is an earnest of Caesare patriotism. Cicero had feared the
victory of his own side: Caesar's spirit was the nobles-7. There is nothing to fear
from the pardoned: the State itself hangs upon Caesar’s lite-n The wounds of civil
wars are to be healed: be must live to restore the republic. -9. This glory still remains:
unless tbe state is restored, his other glories will have no abidingplaoe. - ιο. ΑΗ accept
the results, and wisb bis safety.-11. Cicero is the mouthpiece of all in rendering

thanks
