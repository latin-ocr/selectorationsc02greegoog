and ten days. He was, however, so industrious and skilful in this,
that he returned in fifty days, thus completely foiling the next
plan of the opposition, which was to bring on a trumped-up action
before the court, which should have precedence of that against
Verres, merely to consume time. Cicero returned, with ample evi-
dence, even Before his rival had left Italy. The trial was now fixed
for Aug. 5, nc. 70, in the consulship of Pompey and Crassus.

Meantime (in the latter part of July) the elections were held for ’

the next year, —as was the custom inRome, several months before

the newly·elected magistrates entered upon their offices3 the J
successful candidate, under the title of desrgnatun enjoyed a dig· ’ ,
nity almost equal to that of an actual magistrate, although with no ,
real power (see ch. ix). ln these elections Cicero was designated ’
aedile; but his rival Hortensius was chosen consul, with Quintus ,

Metellus Creticus, Verres’ fast friend, as his colleague. More than

this, Marcus Metellus, brother of Quintus, was chosen praetor, and ἵ

the lot fell to him to preside the next year in the court of Repetun-
dre. lf now the trial could be put over till the next year, when
Hortensius and the two Metelli would be in the three most influen-

tial positions in the State, Verres felt quite sure of getting clear. =

N either did it seem as if this would be very hard to bring about ;
for the last six months of the Roman year were so full of festivals
and other days in which the courts could not sit, that the case would
be liable to constant interruptions and delays. This would have
been a sore disappointment to Cicero, for, by good luck in drawing
¹ the names, and sagacity in challenging, he had ajury that he could
trust, and he was not willing to run the risk of a change.

Under these circumstances Cicero made the second speech of the
Verrine group-that which is known as the Actio Prima. In this
he proved so conclusively the guilt of the defendant and his hope
to escape by bribery, and at the vsame time showed himself so der
termined to urge the ease through before the New Year‚ that he
hardly had any need to produce his witnesses. Hortensius soon
threw up hiecase, and Verres went into exile, with a name for ever
associated with extortion and 'misgovernment F ull restitution of
the plunder was, however, not obtained: a compromise was made,
by which a less sum was pald in satisfaction of the el'aims. The
five speeches known as the “Accusation” (Actio Secundo) were
never delivered, but were written out and published in order to put
on re'cord the facts which the orator had gathered withso much pains.
