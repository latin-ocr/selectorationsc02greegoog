ln the structure of this opening sentence, notice the antithetic balancing of one word ⁶

or clause against another, which marks the Latin perindie style (see l ⁷6, 4). lt consiste
ol two parts, —the first Concessive, introduced by qraamqrcam, the second Adversative,
introduced bytom So, in the first, conspectus balances lomes, which is brought into
relies by aarum (aud again); while ad mendum amplissimus and ad &endum orna·
thrimsa are balanoed in like manner against each other· ln the second, the relative
clause qui . . . patuit (virtually concessive) is, as usual, embodied in the main clause,
bringing the relative as near as possible to its antecedent driu ; voluntas and rationes
are set iu antithesis by sed,· while the main verb, praedurum, as usual, comes last. 'l'he
logical form os the whole is, “Though political speaking is agreeable, yet l havebeen
prevented,’' &c ·

By stating first the leading thought (boc adria, ete), and putting the verb at the end
(the most emphatic place), Latin is able to make the main clause active, thus partly dis-
guising the antithesis. But here, as elsewhere, it isos great help in reading to observe
these two rules: (1) that Latin puts first the main idea, the key to the whole; and (κ) that
it comtantly deals in antitheses, often forcing them when they do not naturally occur (as
in amplissimus and vnathsimur), each thought or expressim having its pendant, like
(ἔηαφευίο wh)ich goin pairs. (See note ou the opening sentence ol the oration on

Roman lawyer was not regarded as doing a service for hire, hut
was expected to defend his friends gratuitously. He was, indeed,
prohibited from receiving pay. No bargain was made, but it was
understood that the obliged party gave a liberal present to his
