POMPEY'S MILITARY COMMAND.

(For tlte Mam'lian Low.)
nc. 66.

Ture last serious resistance made to the Roman power in the
East was by Mithridates Vl, king os Pontus, whose dominions
embraced the whole eastern coast os the Black Sea (Pontus Euxi-
nus), including the kingdom oi Bosporus (Crimea) on the one hand,
