ln the structure of this opening sentence, notice the antithetic halancing of one word ·

or clause against another, which marks the Latin perindie style (see ἱ 76, 4). lt consists
of two parta-the first Concesswe, introduced by murorum, the second Adversative,
introduced by iam so, in the first, conspectur balanees hero, which is brought iuto
relief by auteur (and againh while ad agendm amplissimus and ad dicendm orna·
rosim are balam in like manner against each other· In the second, the relative
clause qui. . . paruo (wnuassy concessive) is, as usual, embodied in the main clause,
bringing the relative as near as possible to its antecedent aditu voluntas and rationes
are set in antithesis by sed ,¹ while the main verb, promserunt, as usual, cornea last. 'l'he
togzeat form of thewlrole is, “Though politicsl speaking is agreeable, yet 1 have been
prevented,” &e ·

By stating first the leading thought (hoc adriu, etc), and putting the verb at the end
(the most emphatic place), Latin is able tc make the main clause active, thus partly dis·
guising the antithesis. But here. aa elsewhere, it isof great help in reading to observo
these two rulest (r) that Latin puts first the main idea, the key to the vhole; and (2) that
itconstautly deals in antitheses, ctien forcing them when they do not naturally occur (as
in amplhsimus and ornatesim), each thought or expression having its pendant. like
{maments which goin pairs. (See note on the opening sentence of the oration on

Roman lawyer was not regarded as doing a service sor hire, but
was expected to defend his friends gratuitously. He was, indeed,
prohibited from receiving pay. No bargain was made, but it was
understood that the obliged party gave a liberal present to his
