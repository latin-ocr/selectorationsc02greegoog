nearly forty was adopted hya young married man os twenty named Fonteius· obviously
in complete violation of the spirit of the institution. Hence, and by reason of tome other
gross informalities, Cicero sedulously speaks of it as invaiid, from which it would result
that the tribunate of Clodius was illegal, aud all his laws null and void.

Again, if it had beena genuine adrogatio, Clodius rnust have taken the name of his '
adoptive father, while in the case of transito ad plebem the patrician name was pre·
served. The fact that Clodius kept his name, proves that the ceremony of adoption was
onlya subterfuge, merted to on account of some scrupfe of Metellus.

near the eastern end of the Forum, and under it were supposed to
be buried the razor and whetstone of Attus Navius. The tribunal
of the prator, which was originally upon the comitium, at the
western end of the Forum, was removed by L. Scribonius Libo
(thuaneae. 149) to the neighborhood of this puteal, which was
now called puteal Libonis or Scribonianum, and cameto be iden·
