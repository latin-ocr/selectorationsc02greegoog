established in the time ol the dissensions of the orders early in the Republlc, in imitation
of the Ludi Mrgnc' or hmani, and were presided over by the plebeiam ediles.

perpauci: the month of December was full of festivals-rem
integram, i. e. from the beginning. The points of the prosecution
would have been forgotten, the public interest would have cooled
down, and the jury would be almost wholly new. Tbe case must
therefore be taken up de novo.

532. nuno, opposed to si diffisus essem, above-jurato,
on cath. The judices were on oath ; the prator, not. Metellus
might therefore be trusted to vote honestly as juror, but not to pre·
side impartially. -legitimo tempore: he had aright touse twenty
days for developing the points of the prosecution.

ξ 33. perpetua oratione, a continuares argument, before bring·

. ing up the witnesses. This is what we possess in the five speeches
of the Accusatio, which, in the usual order of proceeding, would
have been delivered before bringing up the witnesses, butwhich were
never delivered at all-percipi, reaped: the regular term for
gathering mapa-potuit, might have dcem-publicis, firtel,
i. e. of eines-tabulis, records,· auctoritatibus, documenta.-
res omnis. Here, before stating his plan, Cicero goes off on an·
other digression against Hortensius, which shows clearly one of
his principal motives in undertaking the prosecution-diluendi,
refusing (washing off).

36, explicandis, unfhldingn—nunc, as cites-ex tua na·
tura: Hortensius, like M. Metellus, was personally an amiable and
honorable man, though pledged to a bad cause. -malitioee, in bad
saith-rationi, scheme, looking to the means3 oonsilio, plan,
looking to the end. Cicero contrasts them more than once.

ξ 34. binos ludos, i. e. Pompey's games and the Roman.-
oompereudinem, adjourn ever a day (perendie).

Alter opening the case (as in the present speech), the usual course was for the prose·
otitor to present his proofs and arguments in aoonnectsd speech, or series of speeches (per-
petua nata), to which the consul for tbe defense oould aaswer, and then the witnesses
would be brought forward. The csse was now really complete; but it was required atthis
point comperendinare, i e· adJ'oum over the second day, in order to make sure that the
clnin of evidence was complete. For this actio nanda, as it was properly called, a very
short time only was necessary. The comperendinatione therefore a sign that the trial
was near its close. Cicero’s detennination to bring this about before Pompey’s games-
i. e· within ten days- settled the csse in his favor ; for, as has been shown, the only hope
of the defence lay in putting off the trist. ·

necessarium, uncvcidable .· ld refers to eos velle, etc-amplum
et praeclarum, honor and distinction-periculum, tezel (from
the same root found in expertast-innocentiae, purity of ad·
ministratam in Sicily: an almost technical word for using with

moderatiori the immense power in the hands of a Roman official
in the provinces.
