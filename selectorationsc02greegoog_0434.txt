ἕῐ-ψ] Oratzbn for Ligarius. 131

The Roman state was developed out of the patriarcha] state of society, of which it
retained many characteristic institutions, such as the parma pausat, the enormous
power, even of life and death, possessed by the head ofa family (paterfamiliarl over
those under his legal control, -that is, all sons and descendants in the male line, and all
unmarried daughters. Daughters, upon their marriage, passed froin the mnus of the
father to that of the husband· ¹

The gem was an enlarged family, which had outgrown the centralized power ofa
paterfamilias, and the feeling of near relationship, but which still held in theory to the
belief in a common descent, and which maintained a gentile organisation, possessed certain
property in common, and kept up the observance of certain sacra. The chief object of
adoption (note, Sest.§ ι) was the maintenance of these sacra. lf a person died intes·
tate without heirs, his property went to his gens. The fundamental importance of the genr
in the Roman patriarchal institutions appears in the fact that the gentile name, always
ending in ius (except iu a few Etruscan names in na, as P'apema) was the nomen proper,
while the family name was only cognomenv Some persons, as C· Marius, had no family
name3 but most genter fell into a number of families, and sometimes even these families
were divided into branches, with distinctive names. Thus the Cornelian gens contained
the familias of Scipio, Sulla, Cinna, Lentulus, Dolabella, dte-3 while a branch of the
Scipios retained for many generations the agnomm Nasica. Strictly speaking, there were
no fully organized genter except those oi, the patriciana, as the Cornelii, Julii, Fabii,
Claudii; but the plebeian uobility (see note, Verr. Ι. § rsldeveloped genter of its own,‘
which were quite analogous to those of the patriciana Such were the Caecilii, Sempronii,
Licinii, Livii.

such a lieutenant exercised the imperium of his superior. lt was
usual, although not required, in this case, to appoint the highest
subordinate officer‚ the quaestor; hence this apologetic expression
of the orator (see Momm. Rdm. St. i. p. 178).
