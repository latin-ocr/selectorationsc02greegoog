In the structure oi this opening sentence, notice the antitheticbalancing ot' one word ·

or clause against another, which marks the Latin periodic style (see i 76, 4). lt consiste
ol two parta-the first Concessive, introduced by quampiam, the second Adversative,
introduced bylamen. So, in the interruperint balances locres which is brought iuro
relisi by autem (and again), while ad agendum amplissimus and ad neema orna·
rasim are balanced in like manner against each other· ln the second, the relative
clause qui . . . putul (virtually concessive) is, as usual, embodied in the main clause,
bringing the relative as near as possible to its antecedent aditu ,· adamas and ralr'ones
are set in antithesis by red; while the main verb, prohibuerunt, as usual, comes last. 'l'he
logical surm oi the wholeis, “Titough political speaking is agreeable, yet l have been
prevented‚” &c ·

By stating tirst the leading thought (loc aditu, eto), and pntting the verb at the end
(the most emphatic plaoel, Latin is able to make the main clause active, thus partly dis·
guising the antithesis. But here, as elsewhere, it isos great help in reading to observe
these two rules: (r) that Latin puts first the main idea, the key to the whole ; and (ι) that
it oonstantly deala in antitheses, olien forcing them when they do not naturally ootur las
in ampliissima and armasimul, each thought or expression having its pendant, like
ornaments which go in pairs. (See note on the opening sentence ol the oration on
