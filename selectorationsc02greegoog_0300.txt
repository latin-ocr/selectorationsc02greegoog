§¹8·²⁶·l Impeaclrment of Verres. 27

Metellus was so great, that he did not even yet see through the
tricks of the defence. - certis, trusty. -reperiebamz the imperf·
denotes a succession of items of information-fleoos, wicker
baskets, used for carrying money. The word came to mean treas·
ure-adest, or private treasury; and, when the empire was established,
it was applied to the emperor’s privy-purse. Hence the word fiscall
-Sioilienee‚ iethet extorted in Sicily. —eenatore‚ etc. The
senator,a man of the same class as Verres, put the money to be
used iu the elections and trial into'the hands of an eques, one of
the class that had the management of all such financial operations.
He retained, however, say (quasi) ten baskets, tube used directly
to defeat Cicero’s election to the aedileship. - nomine. an account
afl—divieoree, manageis. The money to be used at elections was
put into the hands of sequestres (election agents), who themselves
made use of divisores to approach the voters personally. On this
occasion, the exigency was so great that Verres himself (letum)
called the divisores to his house, without the mediation of se-
questres. '

§23¹ omnia debere, was bound to da any thing far me.-
proximie, tlte last—negasse audere, said they did not dare. -
sonem, standi (ironical)‚ in allusion to audere—Romilia, sc.
tribu. -ex optima disciplina, from thebert school (ironical)‚ i. e.
that of Verres’ father. -Η, S. (see § 85, 1-3) : the defeat of Cicero
would, therefore, cost about 325000, which the purchasing power
ol money made full twice as valuable then as now.

§ 24. A lively description of the embarrassment in which Cicero
was placed at the end of July by the election and the trial, both
coming on together.—agere deterrebar, I was deterreri from
doing (5 57, 8, d). - petitioni, canvass. - ratio, my policy.

38, ξ 25. hoo lpso tempore, in the midst of all-denun-
tiatum ease, that a message was sent. This compound implies a
peremptory and threatening message—prlmum corresponds to
arcessit, etc, § 27. -sane liberos, quite free, i. e. in refusing to
come. lf he had been consul, instead of merely consul-elect, they
would have had to come-cursare, run ln'tlter aad thither.-
appellare et convenire, aecost and greet.

ᾖ 26. Μ. Metellum (see ξ 21), the friend of Verres, who had
obtained the presidencyof the court of Repetnndoe for the next
year. -eo, titis thing, i. e. postponing the trial-praerogativam,
indication. In the comitia centuriata, it was determined by lot
which century should first cast its vote. The vote of this century,
called prerogativa (prae-rogo), was regarded as an omen, and was
likely to decide the result. The prerogativa which Q. Metellus
gave'to Verres, in return for the prerogativa of 'the comitia, is

described in the next section.
