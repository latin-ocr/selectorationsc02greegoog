i. e. the year of Caesar’s consulship, and ot the plebeian adoption
of Clodius. (For the tense, compare § ⁵8, 5, a). -ignari rerum,
not knowing tlte facts. —re quidem vera, but in truta. -traduc-
tione, transfer. This word seems to imply some fling at the irre-
gularity of the proceeding by which Clodius a man of forty, was
adopted as son bya youth of twenty. The correct legal term is
transitzb.

Α patrician who wished to hold the plebeian office of tribune, which was the great
engine of political power, might make a formal renunciation of the privileges of his rank:
in this case, being no longera patrician, he os course belonged to the commonalty, or
plebs· 'l'his was called tramitti) ad plebem (Momm. Ram. Forsch· i. p. 124), and the for-
mal act by which it took place was called detestata sacrorwm (renunciation of the sacred
rites). Clodius attempted this simple process s. c. 60, but was prohibited for some reason
by the consul, Metellus Celer, and the next year became a member of the plebs by adoption
into a plebeian family.

lt was a common practice in Rome, if a family was in danger of becoming extinct, to
adopta young man of some other family, who now stood to his adoptive father precisely ·
as bis own sont and although it might be that he was not cognatus (blood relation), yet
was recognized aa agnatus (descendant in the male line. See Maiae, Ancient Law, p. 125).
The most familiar example of thiais Scipio Africanus the younger, whose waren.
AEmihmus, indicated that he was bybirthamemberof the AEmilian gens. lt the person
adopted was sui juris, that is, had been freed from the parra potestas of his father,
by his father's death or in any other way, the adoption was called adrogatio. It was an
act of grem fonnality, and the circumstances must first be examined by the pardfices. to
make sure that the sacra of the person adopted should suffer no loss, and that the person
adopting had no hope of legitimare heirs. The act must then be submitted to the Comitia
of the cunia-an ancient division of the peopie, originally purely patriciam but atter-
wards embracing plebeians also (Momm. i. p. 140). This assembiy had been superseded
for all practical purposes by those of the centurias and tribes (see note, Verr. Ι. § 18). but
was still kept up for a few formal acts, as this of adrogatio, and the annual law conferring
the imperium -lex curata de imperio. It was so far a mere formality that for the latter
purpose the thirty Curiae were represented by thirty bailiffs (lictors). When the curia
met merely to witness an act, as testaments, or detestatio sacrorum, the assembly was held
in the Curia Calabra on the Capitoline, and was called comitia calata.

Tite consul Caesar, being also pontifex maximus, managed the whole affair for his
tool, Clodius; and the adoption was clearly and ostentatiousiy a farce. A senator of
