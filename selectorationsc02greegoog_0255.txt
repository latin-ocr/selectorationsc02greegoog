THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ANTONY.

n, c· 43· .

Juuus Cassan was assassinated on the Ides of March (March
15), n. e. 44, by a band of conspirators‚ headed by Marcus lunius
Brutus and Caius Cassius Longinus. The conspirators fanciedthat
if the dictator were out ol the way the Republic could be restored.
But the success of Caesar had made any return to the republic
impossible. Nor had the conspirators made any provision for
their own sasety‚ much less for getting control of the government
The only question was, who should succeed to the power of the
murdered dictator. . And the only persons who had any chance ol
doing so were Mark Antony, Caesar’s surviving colleague in the
consulship, and the young Caius Caesar Octavianus, Caesar’s grand
nephew‚ adopted son, and heir, afterwards the emperor Angustus.

Antony had come into possession of Caesar's papers and estates,

abolished the office of dictator, and secured as large a share of
authority as he could. He was a man of inordinate ambition, con-

married for his third wife Fulvia, widow of Publius Clodius, and
shared, with her, that tribune’s vindictive hate of Cicero. His col·
league, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, Cicero's son-inlaw, had been
appointed by Caesar to succeed him as consul, and assumed the
office at his death. He dallied with the conspirators‚ suppressed
the violence of the mob that threatened them, and might have had
some pretensions to the power, with the support of the aristocracy,
but was easily outgeneralled or bought off by Antony. Lepidus,
who hada military command, and in whom the aristocracy had some
hope, was also gained over by Antony. ’ Octavianus, now twenty

years old, hastened from Epirus to claim his inheritance, and take 3

„part in the conflict which he saw approaching. He was a young

man of precocious talent, of cool and wary temper, of ambition ,

equal to Antony's, and oia politica} sagacity which, through his
long lise, seems never to have been at fault

Neither of the two chief claimants wasstrong enough alone to
be quite independent of the other; though at first they stood in the
