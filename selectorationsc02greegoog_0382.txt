513-22.] Catilina III. 77

5 18. quod .. . potuisse (parenthetical), because, &c -courili
limits gubernatio in the predicate: to belong to human merdam
tum (below) auswers to cum. -facaa etc: these. omens are such
as the Romans observed and noted carefully. Livy's history is full
of them-praetermittendum, inadvertently ; relinquendum, in·
tentionally. ·

5 19. Cotta et 'torquata consuls u. c. 65, the year in which
Catiline's conspiracy was first intended to break out-arra: the
laws were engraved on bronze tables. Some of these are still ex·
tant.-illa...Romuius: it is disputed whether this was the
bronze statue of the wolf suclding the infants, which is now in
the Capitoline Muscam at Rome, and which bears marks either
of lightning scaming one ofits hind legs, or of some defect in
the casting. Mommsen (V ol. I. p. 608) holds it to be the same.-
flexierent ε in dir. disc. ssoxennt, following appropinquare, which
has a future sense.

5 20. iilomm,·the haruspices-idem (plna), they also.

118, contra atque, opposite to what (5 43, 3, a). — rolin . . .
conspiceret: this is one o'f the most conclusive passages in sup·
port of the view that the Capitolium, or Temple of Jupiter Capi·
tolinus‚ was on the south-western point of the hill. A statue here,
facing east, would also face (conspiceret) the forum and comitium,
which would not be the case with one upon the north-eastern point.
—conlocandum locaverunt: the regular expression for giving
out a contract (5 ⁷2, 5, c). - 1111, of year before last. -oonaulibne
and nobie, abl. abs. expressing the date (5 84, 1).

5 21. pracepe, madrtrong3 monto captus, insana-hmo
omnia, i. e. the universe. —rei publicae (dat), against tlu State.
—in sedem concordie: one of 'the principal temples at the
northern end of the Forum, where the Senate had held its session
on this day. lt was built by the consul L. Opimius, Β. c. 121, after
his bloody victory over C. Gracchus. One would almost think ita
piece of satire.

522. quo: abl. of means (5 ⁵4, 6, e).-aidicam, isI should
say· (5 59, 4, b).—illa: the words in brackets are a manifest
gloss.

119, gene relates here to the Gauls as awholc, not to the
Allobroges in particular—ultro, vernanola-patriciis: the
patricians were the original citizens of Rome3 and the plebeiam,
the mass, were their clients or dependants, foreign residente, and
emancipated slaves. When the plebeiam, after a contest of more
than a hundred years, obtained an equality of political rights, the
original patrician families still continued to be an hereditary aris·
tocracy, with no political privileges, but with the exclusive right to
certain positions of mere honor and dignity, such as the princeps
