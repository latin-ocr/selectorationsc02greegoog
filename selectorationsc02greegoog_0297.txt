was let by the censore, generally lor along term os years, sometimes as heritable. These
tenants were called aratores. ln Sicily the original proprietors received back their old
estates on these terme, peying tithes, mmm just ae the proprietors οἱ ager privatur did,
from whom therefore they differsd only in right oi property, not in amount ol tax or mode

Thus, Jesus was crucified by the Roman governor under the or-

In Chnp. vi. the orator returns to the charge ol bribery. He has shown at close of
Chap. iii. that Verres had been disappointed in the character ot' the jury: the two following

the trial till the next year.
