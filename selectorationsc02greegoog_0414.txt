§13·21·] Drfi‘nce os anto. 111

ξ 16. Tubllo clodio: the name is given in full to emphasize the

person—tempori the troubled time, which demanded the inves-
tigation. — Catonis : Μ. Porcius Cato (the Younger), a stern cham-
pion of the senate, wh0‚ when Caesar had destroyed the hopes of
his party, killed himself at Utica,— hence called Utt'censzse-Dru-
sus: M. Livius Drusus (son of Marcus) was murdered by some
unknown person on returning home from an exciting political
debate (Β. c. 91).—Afrioan0, i. e. AEmilianus. He was actively
opposed to the pians of C. Gracchus for the division of the Latian
, lands3 and, while the controversy was at its hottest, was found
dead in his' bed, with marks (it was thought) of strangulation. His
wife, sister of the tribune, and Gracchus himself, lay under some
suspicion of the crime. -quem immortalem, etc. Scipio died
at the age of fifty-six. -dolore, indzg'nation.

ἕ 17. quia, eto, i. eit is question of persons—summorum,
infimorum, simply high and low—intersit, grant a di erence
(hortat. suhj.).-quidem, yen-monumentis, memorial: i. e.
the road itself. The Appian Way was constructed Β. c. 312, by
the censor Ap. Claudius CaecuS, an ancestor of Clodius. This
circumstance is skilfully used to tell against Clodius, rather than
in his savoa-ille, the famous. ¹

ς 18. Μ, Papirium: this was one of Clodius’s earliest exploits.
Papirius, a friend of Pompey, was killed in a brawl about a son of
Tigranes, held as hostage at Rome, whom Clodius was tryiug to
rescue and send back for a great ransom to Asia, having by a trick
got him out of the hands of his custodian.

177, ‘templo castoris, where the Senate was then holding
session. The circumstance took place in the year of Clodius's
tribunate (Β. c. 58), while Pompey was in the Senate. “He in·
stantly went horne and stayed there.”—oaruit, stayed away from.

ξ 19. certe haeo, surely all these, res, vir, tempus-summa,
in the haghest degree-eo tempore, i. e, during the violences
which followed the exile of Cicero (see oration for Sestius). -pro-
inde quasi, just as {fidae That is, the overt act must be judged
by its obvious intent: of course no tribunal (except au inquisition)
would attempt to try men for their intentions (consilia).

§ao adflictantur: this word refers to the outward signs of
violent grief, such as wringing the hands or beating the breast.
This whole exaggerated description is probably in lively contrast
with the fact.

178, ς 21. tetendimus be proposed to the people. -reoon
olliatae: Pompey had lately renewed friendly relations with Clo-
dius—fortiter, firmly.-delegit1 the choice of the judices was ‘
left to Pompey, as the Senate had decreed it to be left to the praetor
in the trial of Clodius (see note,§13).-secrevit, set asida-
