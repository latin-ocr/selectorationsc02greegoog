the subject of sit is ali that follows, being a clause with quod
(ξ 70, 5), of which surrexerim is the main verb, and ali the other
clauses are modifiers. —The clause oum . . . sedeant is a kind of
adverbia] modifier of surrexerim, while the clause' qui. sim . ..
comparandus is a kind of adjective modifier oi ego the subject
of surrexerim, and qui sedeant is a kind of adjective modifier of
his. - omnes hi, etc, is an independent sentence, but is connected
in thought with the preceding, and explains the fact at which the
jurors are supposed to be surprised, ie, I supposeyou wonder, etc,
but tie fact is, etc.

NB. Notice, as a praetiosi gulde, thatin Latin (as in all ianguages) the verb nextsol-

relative has its verb first, aud the first relative clause is suspended; butenen then, the next
following verb will belong to the former relative. A eereiid attention to anaiyeis, like that

ego: not emphatic itseif, but only expressed to set off vos. which
is. The Latin is so fond of putting prououns in antithesis, that one
is often (as here) expressed on purpose-jndices: not judges, but
rather jurare. They were persons selected by law to try facts (under
the presidencyof a prator or judex questionis), and were often quite
numerous, lrom a single one to'fiity or more. Δ

clause of fact (ξ 70, 5), taking the subj. on account of the indirect
