In the structure of this opening sentence, notice the antithetis balancing of one word ·

or clause against another, which marks the Latin perindie style (see 5 76, 4)¹ It consisto
of two parta-the first Concessive, introduced by quamquam, the second Adversativa
introduced bytom So, in the first, contactae balances locum which is brought into

Α ’ relief by mm (and againlt while ad wedam amplissimus and ad &caum orna·

arsamus are balanced in like manner against each other. In the second, the relative
clause qui . . . parua (mnually concessive) is, as usual, embodied in the main clause,
bringing the relative as near as possible to its antecedent adda ,¹ voluntas and ranam
are set in antithesis by κώ· while the main verb, parauerunt, as usual comes last. fi'he
lognal form of the whole is, “Though political speaking is agreeable, yet l have been
prevented,’' &e- ·

By stating first the leading thought (hoc adsim etc-i, and putting the verb at the end
(the most emphatic plane), Latin is able to make the main clause active, thus partly dis·
guising the antithesis. But here, as elsewhere, it isof great help in reading to observa
these two rules: (r) that Latin puts first the main idea, the key to the whole: and (2) that
it constantly deals in antitheses, often forcing thern when they do not naturally occur (as
in amplissimus and ornatosimm), each thought or expression having its pendant, like
ornaments which go in pairs. (See note on the opening sentence of the oration nn
Roscius, n 1·)

common word to denote the condition of an accused person). A
Roman lawyer was not regarded as doing a service for hire, but
was expected to defend his friends gratuitously. He was, indeed,
prohibited from receiving pay. No bargain was made, but it was
understood that the obliged party gave a liberal present to his
atronus. ,

eight praetors were regarded as colleagueS, and determined their
several fonctions-as urbanus, peregrinus, or president of quas· '
