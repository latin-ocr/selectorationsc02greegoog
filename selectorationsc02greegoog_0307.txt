Tun Pnownnn or SYRACUSE.

Tira passage which follows is from the fourth oration of the
Accusatio, the most famous of 111, known as the Dc Signis, for the
reason that it treats chiefly of the works' of Art stolen by Verres.
Cicero bas been describing the plundering of many temples and
public buildings ; and in this passage he recounts in detail the case
of one chief city, Syracuse, as a climax.

Syracusewasfar thelargest and richest of all the Greek cities of Italy and Sicily. lt
was a colony of Corinth, founded a c. 734, and in course of tinu obtained the rule over
the whole eastern part of Sicily. Syracuse remained independent, with a considerable
territory, after the western part of the island (far the largest part) passed under the power
of Rome in the First Punic War; but in the Second Punic War (a. c 212) it was captured
by Marcellus, and ever afterwas subject to Rome. ir was at this time the capital of the
province.
