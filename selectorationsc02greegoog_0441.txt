proposition oia supplicatu (see note, Cat. l ii. 15), which had never
been decreed except for a victory over foreign enemies, indorses
this view by treating Antony as an enemy—nefarium scelus:

ators against Caesar), aud put him to death with indignities and
tortura-hoo templo: i. e. that of Jupiter Capitolinus where the
Senate was now met-Parmensium: Parma had been captured
by Antony, and treated in the manner here described—propu-
dium et portentum, prodtgy of wicardum-12. Antonius, the
youngest brother of Mari< Antony (cos. n. c. 41).
