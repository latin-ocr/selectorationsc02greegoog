§ro-13] Exr'le os Cicero. 97

sent-furta, etc„ Clodius—vestro: i. e. of the judices, men ol
senatorial and equestrian rank-roos ao sententia (dendrodys),
their loudly expressod opinion-auspicia: as in the Roman polity
every action depended on the auspices, or expressed will ol the
gods, forits validity, and the magistrates alone possessed the right
to look for them (spectio), any magistrate possessing the auspices
could, unless prohibited by edict (see below), stop legislation by
announcing to the presiding magistrates uniavorable omens in the
sky (obnuntiare), or even, as it appears, by declaring his intention
oi watching ior them. This means could be used even against the
comitto tributo. -

Τὴο Senate and higher magistrates sometimes defended the passage of their laws from
this interierence, by prohibiting any magistrate servare dr calo oa the day οἰ the comr'tr'o,·
and the whole process was regulated by the AElian and Fufian laws (about s. c· 150)· The
precise purport ol these laws is not known, but the present passage is one ol our principa]
sources οῖ’ inionnation in regard rothem. Obnuntorio was the sole means by which the
patrician magistrates could control the legislation nithe tribunes. This seems to have
been distinctly put in their hands by the AElian and Fulian laws, and taken away lrom
thern by the Clodran law, which also appears to have limited in some way the power ol
the tribunes to prevent legislation by “intercedingt (see note, Verr. 1. ς 44). Thus
Clodinswas relieved from the interierence ol his colleaguea as well as oi the patrician
magistrates (consul, prator, curule aedile, and quaestor-so called, not as being held by
patricians exclmively, which they were not, but as being oi patricias origin).

intercederet, the technical word lor the interierence (voto) oi the
tribunes- omnibus iestis diebus, on any legal business day.

The dies sorti were the days on which the praetor could hold his court: they were
the Kalends, Nones, and ldes of each month, together with the nundina (day hall-way
between ldee and Kalends), unless any ol these days were rendered unavailable by
. religious services (see Momm. Rhm.Chron-p 239). They were therefore about lorty
in number. Other days were partially unavailable (diss intereos). On dies fasti, comr'tr'a
could nothe held; and the festival days in the Roman year were so numerous that there
remained only about ¹90 days in all ior the comittit. The Clodian law seems to have
provided that the dios sorti should also be dies comitiales (see note, verr-141).

lexAElla, alaw oi Q. AElius (cos, s. c. 148) 3 Fufia, ol the tribune
F ufius; providing lor the above legal methods'of delaying public
business. Both these laws were regarded as important saleguards
against hasty and partisan legislation.

ξ 13. pro tribunall, in front of tlte tribunal, a raised platlorm
or judgmentseat. The Aurelian tribunal was near the eastern end
ot' the F orum-nomine conlegiorum, see note, ξ 11.

The associatione here spoken of are the collegia compitalicius, organisations whose
object was to conduct the sacred rites oi the compita (eroes-reads). The whole territory
was divided into districts, - pagi in the country, and uisi in the city: and each district
had its local sacra, held at irs central compitum, and addressed to its lares, or local

s divinities. The collegio which had charge ol these, although 'nominally religione, were
turned into ‘⁴ street-dubs.” under the control ol pothouse politicians. They were “nothing
else than a formal organizanon -subdivided according to streets, and with almost a mili-
tary arrangement-oi the whole free and slave proletariate ol the capital” (Momm).
These clnbs were suppressed by the senate, s. c. 69, and were now revived hy Clodius, to
ald him in his schemes.
