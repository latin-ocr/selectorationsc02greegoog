the comitia centuriata, in which the higher magistrates were
elected (see note, Verr. I. ξ 18), were held in the Campus Martius,
north of the city, just outside the walls—the level space in which
the modern city is chiefly situated. -ausplolis, ablative : as it was
only through the auspices that the Campus was consecrated.

The Roman commonwealth was regarded as resting directly upon the will os the gods,
expressed in signs sent by thern. auspr'cr'rc. The magistrates alone were authorized to
consult the auspices (spectu), which was done by special formalities; and the auspices,
when observed, were interpreted bya special board (collegium) of priests called Augurs·
All important public acts were done auspicato, that is, under authority ol the auspices:
the right ot interpreting these was therefore a source of great political intluence to the
board of augrus, which was composed oi men of the highest rank and distinction. Cicero
himself became a member of this board ten years after his consulship. The rulesof inter·
pretation were developed into a special seleuce called jue mnam. Most public acts
must be performed ausperto. that is, aster consulting the auspicem especially all public
assemblies in whssch business was transacted. Thus the Campus was “consecrated by
auspices’' every time that the comata centurata were held The enclosure upon the
Campus, called rapta or norb, in which tbe assembly met, was like the Curata, or Senate·
house, and the rostra, orspeaker’s stand, specially set apart and consecrated as a umplurn,
