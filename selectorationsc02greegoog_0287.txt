15. proscripti eunt: the indic. must mean those already pro
‘scribed when the law was passed. F uture cases would be re·
ferred to by the subj. or sut pers. (see Verr. ii. cb. 41, 42).—ad-
veternorum praesidiis, within tlte enemies’ lines, i. e. in arms.-
bona, llic property-veteres, those of the regular code: novas,
those of the Sullan revolution.

§ 38. in eum, i. e. Sulla. Here it is necessary for the orator tu ’
proceed with great caution: even if not himself present, Sulla y
would watch jealously the first case before his own criminal court
-ab initio, from tlte beginning of this trial; omni tempore, in
his whole career-ut. . . passus non sit, clauses in appos. wilh
haeo omnia: for the change of tense, see §58. 5, cri-apud ad·
versarios, in the enemies’ ranks=in prandiis, above-postea:
the passage referred to appears to have been lost out of the oration,

. probably in the gap in ch. 45. The scholiast represents Chrysogn
nus as saying that he had used the property in building a villa at Veii.

ξ 39. Kal. suniae, acc. in the same constr. as diem-aliquot
post mensis, see introd-tabulas, the records oi confiscated
property, which belonged to the State—nulla, not at all (54⁷,6).-
redierunt=relata sunt-nebulone, known-facetius, more
neatly: in the case supposed, the proscription would be amere
trick, and the property would be taken without even the forms of
law-corruptas, temperavimus-ante tempus, prematnrely.- Ἴ
reduviam curem, trenta sore'finger (a proverbial expression):
i. e. in a case of life and death, Ι deal only with some trifling ail-
ment -non rationem ducit, lte does not take account (a mercan-
tile phrase). » l

5 40. partlm pro me, partly in my own name. To avoid en· ³
tangling the case of his client with politics, Cicero makes himself Ἴ
responsible for all that might have a political bearing: he wasa l
known partisan of the nobility‚ and could afford to speak freely.

16. ad omnis pertinere, concerns all-sensu ao dolore,
feeling and pain, i. e. painful feeling. The adjective idea is en·
forced by dwelling on it in the sorm of another noun (nendum).-
jam, with the fut, presently.

§ 41. ego, opp. to Roscia-diem, fem. (ς 13, 2, w.).-prae·
finita, fixed in advance, as the limit (finio). -tantulo, so little.-
patronum‚ i. e. Sulla. (See note on libertus, ξ 12.) -oonierra,
llzrow tlte responsibz‘lity.-impruuenm without theknowledgervfi-
egerit, will effer& fut. perf. sor fut. (§ ⁵8, 7, re). ¹

ξ 42. placet, ab I like? i. e. do I think n ngntt-lmprnden· ’
na, want of fornagia-etenim si, etc. The comparisou is ³
