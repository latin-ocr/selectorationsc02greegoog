IMPEA CHMEN Τ OF VERRES.

nc. 70.

Carus Vernus, a man oi noble birth, but notorious for his
crimes and exactions in the civil war and in the offices he had held
since, was city praetor (prator urbanus) nc. 74 At the close
of his term ol office, he went, in accordance with the law, as pro·
praetor, to govern the province ol Sicily. By reason ol the dis·
turhed condition ol Italy, srom the revolt ol Spartacus, he was not
relieved at the end of a year, as the law required, but continued
two years longer in the guvernment of the province, when he was
succecded by Lucius Caecilius Metellus. During these three years
he was guilty of the most abominable oppressions and exactions;
and, as soon as they were relieved ol his presence, the Siciliane
brought a prosecution against him in the court ol Repetundoe (lor

Although the cruelty and rapacity of Verres were notorious, yet
his relations to the Roman nobility gained him the same support

was afforded to Governor Eyre in England, on his return from
Jamalca. Not only Hortensius, but Curio, a man of excellent
reputation, with members of the eminent families of Scipio and
Metellus, stood firmly by him. ’ The only hope ol Verres was in
preventing a fair and speedy trial. First he tried to obtain a prose·
cutor who should be in collusion with him, and would not push him
too hard. For this purpose one Caecilius was put forwerd, an in-
significant person, but a native os Sicily. Cicero’s first speech in
the case was therefore before the praetor Glabrio in person, to show
that he, rather than Caecilins, should be allowed to conduct the
case. This it was not hard to do, and he set out at once for Sicily
to collect evidence, for which purpose he was allowed one hundred
