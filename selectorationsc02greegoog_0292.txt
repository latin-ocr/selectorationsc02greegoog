Seuerontst. Onnes. — strictly speaking the Ordo Senatorius was only another name
for the Senate, the members of which, by virtue of their life tenure of office, and their
aspri! de corps, formed a united body or “order'' in the state. The list of senators,
amounting in general to about 300, was formerly made up bythe Censors from among those

ho had held high magistracies: after the time of Sulla every person who held the quaes·
Zirship-the first grade of the regular magistracy (see note 5 ιι) -was entitled to a seat
in the Senate. The number therefore fluctuated, running up to five or six hundred. The
electione were so largely under the control of the Senate and the magistrates, that it was
very hard for any person not belonging to the nobilitytsee note on § 15) to be chosen to any
office: 'when any such person, novm tomo, entered the Senate, —such as Cato the Censor,
Marius and Cicero, -he be'onged of course 10 the Senatorial order, although he was not
a noble. Such cases, however, were so rare, that it may be laid down as a general truth,
that the Senatorial order and the Nobility were identical, and “new men ’' became ne·
cessarily identified with the class to which their posterity would belong, rather than that
from which tliey came. This double relation of Cicero-a member of the Senate, but
sprung from the Equestrian order- goes 0 great way to explain what is inconsistent and
vacillating in his political career.

Eoussrmsw 00000-’100 11110 Equr'les was properly applied to the members of the
eighteen centuries equitum equo publicas to whom a horse was assigned hythe state,
together with a certain sum of money yearly for its support. Those who served equo puh-
lico must have a fortune of 400,ωο sesterces 1116000), 0οἀ 100 horses were assigned by
the censore, as a mle, to the young meo 01 senatorial families. Το0 centurr‘oeequitum were
therefore composed of young noblemen, [see ‘⁶ Celsi Ramnes,” Hor¹ Α. Ρ. ν, 34²]- When
they entered the Senate, they were (in the later years of the republic) obliged to give up the
public horse: on becuming senators therefore they voted in the centuries ot the first class,
norwith the Equites (see note. on Assemblies, ς 18). This aristocratic body had, how·
ever, long before this period, ceased to serve in the tieldss they formed a parade corps (some
what like the Royal Guards in England), from which active officers of the legion, mouns
were taken. When the Roman equites ceased to serve as cavalry, troops of horse were de·
manded of the allies; and in the time of Caesar we find that the Roman legion consisted
exclusively of infantry, the cavalry being made up of auxiliaries

During the tirne that the equites equo publico still served in the field as cavalry, another
body grew up by their side, of equites equo privato, that is, persons of the equestrian
census, who had a property of 400,οω sesterces, who had not received 0 horse from the
state, but who volunteered with horses of their own. This body consisted mainly 01 young
men of wealth, who did not belong to noble (that is, senatorial) families. No very distinct
line was, however, drawn between the two classes, until the Lex Judr'cr'aria of Caius Grac·
chus fs. c. 123), which prescribed that the judiees should no longer be taken from the
senators, hut from those who possessed equestrian census, and at the same time were not
members of the Senate (000 0010 on judt'cer, R. Α. ἦ 1). This law did not formally exclude
nobles who were not members of the Senate: but the entire body of nobility was so far
identified in spirit and interest with this body, that 00 antagonism immediately grew up
between thern and this new judicial class. A principal cause of the antagonism was that
members of the Senate were prohibited from being engaged 10 any trade or 0001000ος while,
as hasbeen shown above, the Senate, by its control over the electioris, virtually filled its
own racancies, of course hom the ranks of the nobility.

Since rich men of non-senatorial families were thus excluded from apolitical career,
while Senators were excluded from a business life, there were formed during the last century
of the republic two powerful aristocracies, -the nobles, or Senatotial order, a wealthy gov-
erning aristocracy of rank, and the Equestrian order, an aristocracy of wealth, the
counterpart of the moneyed aristocracy of our day. The name Ordo Equestrrhwas' derived
from the 100101 its members possessing the equestrian census; that is, that amount of
property which would have entitled them to a public horse. From the ranke of the nobility
were taken the oppressive provincial governors; the equestrian order furnished thepubli·
cani, the equally oppressive tax-getherers 1t is easy to see, therefore, that neither the law
of Gracchus, which placed the Court of Repetundoe in the exclusive power of the Eques·
trian order, nor that 01 Sulla, which gave itto the senators exclusively, was calculated to
protect the provincials against extortion.
