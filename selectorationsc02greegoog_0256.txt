hope for the republic. Each endeavored to secure the countenance
of the Senate, and to gain control over the public armies ; and
each succeeded in attaching to himself a considerable force, while
neither was strong enough to hold the capital against the other.
Meanwhile Cicero, who at first hailed the death of Caesar as the
restoration of the republic, lost contage, and set out in July for
Greece. Detained, however, by contrary winds, and receiving
more favorable news from Rome, he returned to the city at the end
of August, to fimi that all his hopes were void, Still, he made an
