Gracchus, e. e ιη He held the office of Pontifex Maximus, president cf the board
(collegium) of pontifices, which had the general superintendence of the State religion·
Since in all ancient states the politiori constitution was based on the State religion, the
pontifices exercised great politiml power. They were the earliest jurists; and the office
of their head, the pontifex mximas. was, in Rome, on the whole the first position in
dignityand intluence. Hewas appointed hythe Boardfrom their own number. But, in
the last two centuries ot the republic, it was established that the person to be so appointed
should be designated by popular electiori. This was confined to the minority (seventeenl
of the thirty-five tribes, designated by lot. An absolute choiee by the people was regarded
as inadmissible in religione offices.

Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, a young man of high rank and great personal purity
of character, attempted to carry through some important reforma, particularly toucbing
the tenure of the public lands, e.c.133. Requiring ruore time to make his legislation
’ effective, he attempted illegally tn secure his own re-election as Tribune3 when hewas
attached and killed by a rnob of senators headed by Scipio Nasica. The mother of
Gracchus was a daughter of the great Scipio, the conqueror of Hannibal.
privatus : Nasica at this time was onlya private citizen of consular
rank. He afterwards went into exile, and was made Pontifex Maxi-
mus in his absence. The word privatus is opposed to noe consules,
and the contrast is rhetorically exaggerated. —illa thot cose, plural
for singular, as frequently in Greek. - Ahala, the magister equi-
tum of the famous Cincinnatus: he killed without law the equos ’
Maelius, on suspicion of his aiming at a dangerous power by his
lavish gifts of corn (n. c. 439).

86, novis rebus (the classic expression for a violent change
of government), revolution. - sanante consultum: i. e. ut vibant
consules, etc. The consultum of the Senate was its ordinance,
regularly passed and promulgated, and recognized as valid. lf it
was invalid by reason of informality or intercession of a tribune,
it was called senatus auctoritas, and might still be drawn up in
form, and would still have a certain modified authority-vehe-
mens, severe, as regards Catiline ; grave, coming evergit, as re-
gards the consuls—rei publicae (dat. with deest) : we know well
enough what to do -we have authority enough: it is the execution
thetis remiss.
